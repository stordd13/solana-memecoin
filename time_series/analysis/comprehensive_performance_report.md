## Technical Implementation Details

### Feature Extraction Enhancement
```python
# Dynamic feature generation based on window
for i in range(1, minutes + 1):
    # Log cumulative returns
    cum_return_feature = f'cumulative_return_{i}m'
    if cum_return_feature in features:
        log_feature_name = f'log_cumulative_return_{i}m'
        features[log_feature_name] = np.log(1 + abs(features[cum_return_feature]) + 1e-12) * np.sign(features[cum_return_feature])
    
    # Log rolling volatility
    rolling_vol_feature = f'rolling_vol_{i}m'
    if rolling_vol_feature in features:
        log_vol_feature_name = f'log_rolling_vol_{i}m'
        features[log_vol_feature_name] = np.log(1 + features[rolling_vol_feature] + 1e-12)
```

### Class Balancing Implementation
```python
# Calculate class weights for balanced training
classes = np.unique(y_train)
class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=classes, y=y_train)
class_weight_dict = dict(zip(classes, class_weights))

# Apply to XGBoost
'scale_pos_weight': class_weights[1] / class_weights[0]
```

## Recommendations

### 🎯 Immediate Actions
1. **Use 10-minute window**: Consistently better performance across all metrics
2. **Focus on feature engineering**: Current features insufficient for target performance
3. **Investigate class imbalance**: Despite balancing, recall remains low

### 🔧 Next Steps for Performance Improvement
1. **Advanced Feature Engineering**: 
   - Multi-timeframe features (1min, 3min, 5min, 10min)
   - Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
   - Volume-based features when data available

2. **Model Architecture Enhancement**:
   - Ensemble methods combining multiple models
   - Deep learning approaches (LSTM, Transformer)
   - Hierarchical classification strategies

3. **Data Quality Improvements**:
   - Enhanced token filtering
   - Outlier detection and handling
   - Feature selection and dimensionality reduction

### 📈 Performance Targets Revision
Given current results, suggest revised interim targets:
- **Stage 1 F1**: 0.35 (achievable with enhanced features)
- **Sprint Recall**: 0.25 (gradual improvement focus)
- **Marathon FNR**: 0.30 (acceptable for current model architecture)
