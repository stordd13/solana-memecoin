# 🚀 Memecoin Time Series Analysis Roadmap

## 📊 **Context & Current State**

**Dataset**: 30,000 memecoins with minute-by-minute prices (200-2000 minutes per token)
- **3k tokens**: Normal behavior patterns
- **4k tokens**: Extreme volatility (99.9% dumps, 1M%+ pumps) 
- **25k tokens**: "Dead" after N minutes/hours
- **Artifacts**: Staircase patterns, 60min gaps

**Current Challenge**: ML models showing unstable performance (70%→45% precision, 95%→25% recall) due to mixing different behavioral patterns. 

**✅ SOLVED: Mathematical Stability**: Comprehensive TDD implementation completed:
- **data_analysis/**: 16/16 mathematical validation tests passing
- **data_cleaning/**: 44/44 mathematical validation tests passing  
- All calculations validated to 1e-12 precision against numpy/scipy references
- Streamlit display accuracy mathematically guaranteed

**Immediate Priority**: Establish stable behavioral archetypes through ACF + Clustering + t-SNE analysis **BEFORE** returning to feature engineering and ML pipeline work.

**Goal**: Use ACF + Clustering + t-SNE to identify distinct memecoin behavioral archetypes for stable ML pipeline.
