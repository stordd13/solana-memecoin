## 🎯 Project Overview & Mission

### **Core Mission**
Build a sophisticated ML-powered analysis platform for **Solana memecoins** to identify profitable trading opportunities by discovering and predicting behavioral patterns in the first 24 hours of trading.

### **What You Want to Achieve**
**Build a real-time trading bot for Solana memecoins** that can:
- Execute trades automatically on the blockchain
- Make profitable decisions in the volatile memecoin market
- Operate 24/7 without manual intervention

**Note**: The pattern discovery, ML models, and behavioral analysis are approaches you've tried to reach this goal, but they may not be the optimal solution. The end goal is profitable automated trading, not analysis for its own sake.

### **Core Problem Being Solved**
- **ML Model Instability**: Models showing unstable performance (70%→45% precision, 95%→25% recall)
- **Root Cause**: Mixing different behavioral patterns in unified models
- **Solution Strategy**: Use behavioral archetypes for cluster-specific models

### **Key Objectives**
- Achieve >60% F1 score for pump prediction
- >65% recall on high-volatility marathon tokens
- <25% false negative rate for profitable opportunities
- Real-time classification within 5-10 minute windows

## ✅ What Has Been Done

### **🎉 Major Achievements**

#### **1. Phase 1 Complete: Behavioral Archetype Discovery**
- **9 Production Archetypes Identified**:
  - Death Patterns (>90% dead): Quick Pump & Death, Dead on Arrival, Slow Bleed, Extended Decline
  - Mixed Patterns (50-90% dead): Phoenix Attempt, Zombie Walker
  - Survivor Patterns (<50% dead): Survivor Pump, Stable Survivor, Survivor Organic
- **Multi-Resolution Analysis**: Sprint (0-399 min), Standard (400-1199 min), Marathon (1200+ min)
- **Death Detection Algorithm**: 1e-12 mathematical precision
- **30,519 tokens analyzed** with 74.7% archetype coverage

#### **2. Comprehensive Data Pipeline**
- **Data Quality Analysis**: Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- **Category-Aware Cleaning**: Different strategies for normal/extreme/dead tokens
- **Feature Engineering**: 81 features (10-min window) with temporal safety
- **Automated Pipeline**: `run_pipeline.py` for end-to-end processing

#### **3. ML Models Implemented**
- **Directional Models** (UP/DOWN prediction):
  - LightGBM (short & medium term)
  - Unified LSTM (all horizons)
  - Advanced Hybrid LSTM (state-of-the-art)
  - Logistic Regression baseline
- **Forecasting Models** (price prediction):
  - LSTM forecasting
  - XGBoost/Linear regression baselines

#### **4. Trading Strategy Analysis**

- **Time to 2x**: Average 81.4 minutes for successful pumps
- **Dual XGBoost Architecture**: Category (3-class) + Archetype (17-class) models

### **🔧 What Works Well**

1. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Polars-based fast data loading with caching
   - Handles 30k+ tokens efficiently (~45 seconds full pipeline)
   - Robust death detection for inactive tokens

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Temporal splitting prevents data leakage
   - Per-token scaling handles extreme volatility
   - Rolling features are ML-safe

3. **Behavioral Analysis**
   - ACF (Autocorrelation Function) effectively captures patterns
   - t-SNE visualization shows clear cluster separation
   - Multi-resolution approach captures different timeframes

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Comprehensive testing (200+ tests passing)
   - Interactive dashboards for analysis
   - Modular architecture for easy extension

### **❌ What Didn't Work / Challenges**

1. **Performance Gap**
   - Current: 22.4% F1 score (10-min window)
   - Target: >55% F1 score
   - Sprint recall: 13.1% vs 60% target
   - Marathon FNR: 33.9% vs 25% target

2. **Classification Issues**
   - 74.1% of marathon tokens misclassified as standard
   - Class imbalance affecting sprint detection
   - Need better features for early classification

3. **Failed Approaches**
   - Global scaling across tokens (caused information leakage)
   - Random token splits (violated temporal integrity)
   - Treating extreme volatility as outliers (it's legitimate signal!)
   - Initial unified models mixing all behaviors

4. **Data Limitations**
   - Only price data currently (no volume/liquidity)
   - 25.3% tokens unlabeled (no archetype)
   - Variable token lifespans (200-2000 minutes)

## 🔬 Technical Approaches Tried

### **1. Behavioral Archetype Identification (Phase 1)**
**Approach**: ACF + K-means clustering + t-SNE visualization
```python
# Multi-resolution ACF analysis
- Extract ACF features at key lags [1,2,5,10,20,60]
- 15-feature standardized system
- K-means with stability testing (K=9 optimal)
- Death-aware processing (only pre-death data)
```
**Result**: Successfully identified 9 distinct patterns

### **2. Early Classification Models**
**Approach**: Two-stage XGBoost with feature engineering
```python
# Stage 1: Sprint detection (0-399 min tokens)
# Stage 2: Marathon vs Standard classification
- 5-min and 10-min observation windows
- 43-81 features including log variants
- Class weight balancing
- Bayesian optimization for hyperparameters
```
**Result**: 10-min window better (+21.4% F1) but still below targets

### **3. Feature Engineering Strategies**
**Successful Features**:
- Cumulative returns (1-10 minutes)
- Rolling volatility with log transforms
- Price momentum indicators
- ACF-based pattern features
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)

**Failed Features**:
- Global statistics (data leakage)
- Future-looking indicators
- Constant features from dead periods

### **4. ML Model Architectures**

#### **Tree-Based Models (LightGBM/XGBoost)**
- Fast training (~2-5 minutes)
- Good interpretability
- Best for engineered features
- Performance: 70-85% accuracy on balanced data

#### **LSTM Models**
- **Basic LSTM**: Simple architecture, moderate performance
- **Unified LSTM**: Single model for all horizons
- **Advanced Hybrid**: Multi-scale with attention
  - Fixed windows: 15m, 60m, 240m
  - Expanding window: adaptive history
  - Self & cross-attention mechanisms

#### **Ensemble Approaches**
- Combining tree + neural models
- Weighted voting schemes
- Meta-learning frameworks

### **5. Data Processing Innovations**

#### **Death Detection Algorithm**
```python
# Multi-criteria approach
1. Constant price detection
2. Zero returns analysis
3. Activity threshold checking
# Result: 95%+ accuracy vs manual validation
```

#### **Per-Token Scaling**
```python
# Each token scaled individually
- Handles 200-2000 minute lifespans
- RobustScaler or Winsorizer
- Fitted only on training portion
```
